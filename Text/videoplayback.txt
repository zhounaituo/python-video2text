welcome to the video version of lecture to of 61 a a playlist of videos like this will be posted to the course website before every live lecture and the video playlist contains everything that we're going to say in live lecture all of the contents all of the examples why do these exist well there are a lot of students enrolled in this course even when we ran the first lecture on Zoom we had our crowd and Wheeler has lots of people showed up and these videos are an alternative to coming to life lecture but it's a choice you're certainly welcome to come to live lecture all semester or you can watch these videos and whichever you choose you're not going to miss anything but the point of these videos is actually not just crowd control in many ways they're better because live lecture can be too fast or too slow or if you just don't pay attention for a minute you might miss something important and then be lost for the rest of the hour where is videos you can play faster you can play slow or you can pause you can rewind so that they're all up-to-date even if they're not all brand new and just like live lecture these videos will always start with some announcements
